# reZIDE [![Tests][tests-badge]][tests-link] [![Codecov][coverage-badge]][coverage-link] [![PyPI][pypi-badge]][pypi-link]

_a comfy custom IDE where you can feel right at home_ üè°

Use simple, declarative configuration files to create complex IDEs with a single command!

Think of it like any [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), except:

* You can use any program that you prefer without waiting for anyone else to add a plugin/integration. If you can run it on your command line, you can run it in reZIDE
* You can read and write your configurations easily
* You can share your configurations with others and copy/learn from others' configurations

Or think of it like [tmux](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ckuehl/tmux/), except:

* You don't need to learn new movement commands (use the commands that you already use for your window manager)
* You aren't restricted to applications with a Terminal User Interface (you can open web browsers, pdf previews, video players, etc.)

## Screencap
(insert cool screencap here)

## Requirements
### One of these tiling window managers:

- [x] [sway](https://swaywm.org/)
- [ ] [i3](https://i3wm.org/) (it should work out of the box, but I'm too lazy to install i3 just to test this. if you can confirm on my behalf, please check this box and submit a PR!)

### At least 1 configuration file
See [examples](examples/).

## Installation
I recommend using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for environment isolation:
```
pipx install reZIDE
```

You can also use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if you don't mind modifying your system Python environment:
```
pip install reZIDE
```

## How to use
Run this command for documentation on how to use `reZIDE`:
```
rzd --help
```


## Motivation
(Tiling window managers](https://youtu.be/GKviflL9XeI) are powerful and flexible and I love using them. However, I ran into
one issue: *I'm lazy.*

Whenever I sit down to work, I usually want to open a group of 2+ windows. Each window takes 5s-30s to get to a useful state. That's way too much effort. I couldn't be bothered.

Here are some groups of windows (AKA layouts) that I commonly use:

### python mode
* editor for source code
* editor for tests
* browser for documentation/tickets
* terminal for arbitrary commands like linting, running tests, and installing packages

### web dev mode
* editor for source code
* editor for tests
* small terminal running linter
* small terminal using a filewatcher to run tests
* small terminal running the typescript compiler
* medium terminal for running arbitrary commands

### documentation mode
* editor for document
* browser/pager for source material
* terminal for compiling document into pdf
* pdf viewer for viewing compiled pdf

There were also a lot of consistent configurations that I wanted to use that just wouldn't
work out of the box. I like splitting my monitor up with 25-50-25 or 20-60-20 ratios and
that requires a lot of manual resizing. I could also set up elaborate rules in Sway and
then make sure each window fits into those rules, but I don't even know how that would work
since Sway can resize floating windows or existing windows, but an IDE that creates itself
in an instant wouldn't have any existing windows. And rules affect windows at window creation
so it's like a chicken-and-egg problem


Sure, I could just use `tmux`, but that came with some issues:

* tmux only handles terminals. it doesn't manage browsers, pdf viewers, or anything else
* tmux has its own keybindings. Even if I used `tmux` next to a browser, I'd be using different commands to jump between tmux and the windows. I can't do that! My brain is smol and it can't handle that complexity.

## Goals
* use only i3/sway to manage windows
* create a DIY IDE with a single command
* allow different IDEs to be defined through a readable file (like TOML)
* run arbitrary commands (not just shells and TUIs!)

## Defining an IDE in TOML
This toml config defines a complex IDE in a simple and consistent way. Read the [TOML spec](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables)
for more details on how to write a TOML file. I recommend drawing out the [i3 tree structure](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_tree)
and then typing each node into a toml file as you do a [depth-first traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).

This IDE divides the screen into 3 major sections with a 25-50-25 ratio. The middle and right sections each have
a terminal and the left section is split 60-40 into 2 terminals.
